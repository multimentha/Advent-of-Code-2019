goal:
find maximum thrust; maximum thrust is generated when each thruster has the correct phase setting; phase settings are from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and never repeated

steps:
 * generate permutations of phase settings
 * set up chain input

notes

 * each phase setting is used exactly once
 * each thruster needs 2 inputs during runtime: 1st the phase setting, 2nd the output of the previous thruster (the initial thruster should be fed 0 here)
